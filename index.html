            Software should be so simple. There's nothing physical to make. There's no
            supply chain to manage. It's just people telling computers what to do; Except
            building software is not simple. Why not?
            </p>

            <p>
            We struggle to make sure we're working on the right things, at the same time as
            we talk about business and tech as if they're different entities. Our best
            people aren't engaged and working to their full potential. Is it too much to ask
            that we move fast, in the right direction, and <b>don't</b> break things?
            </p>

            <p>
            Often the first thing we reach for when the works get gummed up is <b>a process</b>.
            This might give the illusion of helping productivity in the short term. However,
            like imposing a religion, it doesn't work for long, and unexpressed resentment
            often lurks beneath the surface. Process is a tactical tool trying to fix an
            organisational problem: It's like teaching a bunch of people to march and
            thinking you have an army.
            </p>

            <p>
            Gathering great people and organising them to achieve a common goal is <b>hard</b>.
            It's also the responsibility of everyone in the team, at every level. This is
            not something that you can sprinkle <b>magic process dust</b> over and call done.
            However not doing it means being OK with mediocre performance and a stagnant,
            low energy working environment. Do it well and you'll have a a fired up mutually
            supportive team who you look forward to achieving great things with.
            </p>

            <p>
            I've experienced most of the bad side of software development. I've had process
            imposed from above. I've been on teams where the weak developers pull down the
            team by hiding behind bullshit, cargo cult processes. I've spent months
            wondering if what I'm working on is important becasue it wasn't clear what the
            business was doing. I've seen shitty codebases get shittier because refactoring
            couldn't be explained in terms of immediate business value.
            </p>

            <p>
            I got pretty sick of it, and I went looking for answers. As I started to dig
            into human performance and how teams work, I discovered that I'd already learned
            a lot of the lessons. I kept finding remedies to the software development
            malaise from a most unlikely source: The time I spent in the <b>Royal Marine
            Commandos</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
            The Royal Marines are the amphibious troops of the Royal Navy,
            acknowledged as one of the world's elite commando forces. Ready to
            deploy anytime, anywhere, in whatever conditions the mission throws
            their way. By sea, land or air. In scorching heat, biting cold or
            dense jungles. The corps is one of the world’s elite fighting forces –
            courageous, selfless and positive in the face of any challenge. The
            secret? Pushing ourselves to the physical and mental limit. </p>

            <p class="lead">
            Not much to do with software development right? WRONG!
            </p>

            <p>
            Achieving elite performance in any field requires becoming acustomed
            to discomfort as you push to the next level. Training for combat is
            this ability distilled and there are lessons to be learned for
            everyone </p>
